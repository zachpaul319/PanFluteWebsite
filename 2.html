		<p style="color:white">This idea came to me when I was enjoying a nice glass of Mountain Dew and decided I wanted a straw with it.  I 
		opened the straw, and when I blew on it to get rid of any excess paper leftover from the wrapper, I noticed
		it produced a sound similar to that of a flute.  I know that's quite a reach, but it caught my attention.  It was 
		from there that I realized hey, maybe I could make an instrument out of this!</p>
		
		<p style="color:white">Given the straw's rather small size, I thought a conventional flute wouldn't be ideal, and thus I decided a 
		pan flute would work best.  I began by first blowing into a straw without altering it in any way.  It was then that I realized
		the quality of the sound was pretty bad.  I came to the conclusion that the straw would have to be closed on one end in order for the
		straw to actually sound like a flute.  After doing some research, I discovered a method in which I could seal one end of the straw!  To
		do this, I held up one end of the straw with some plyers, leaving about a millimeter of straw hanging out.  Then, I took a lighter to
		that millimeter of straw and held it there for a few seconds.  Through the beauty of physics, the end of the straw became sealed, and
		I was now able to produce a better sound!  The picture below gives you a better idea of how I accomplished this:</p>

		<p style="color:white">Now I was ready to start the musical aspect of things.  I wanted the lowest note on the flute to be a C, so I got
		to work on making the longest straw of the instrument a C note.  Using my knowledge of the fact that <strong><i>a longer tube will have a lower
		pitch than a shorter tube,</i></strong> I kept cutting the straw shorter until the straw produced a C5 note.  How did I know the note was C5
		you may ask?  Well, I recorded myself playing the straw in Audacity, and plotted a spectrum of the frequency I just played.  Once I analyzed
		the spectrum, I consulted my Equal-Tempered Scale sheet and compared it to the frequency of a C5 note, which is roughly 523.3 Hz.  Below is
		the spectrum for the C5 note:</p>

		<p style="color:white">I then repeated this process for the rest of the straws.  Each successive note in the scale would get a shorter and
		shorter straw length to account for the higher pitch.  Eventually, I reached the top of the scale.  See the spectrum for B5 below:</p>

		<p style="color:white">Once I had all of the straws cut to their appropriate lengths, I simply taped them all together so that the instrument
		as a whole represents that of a pan flute.</p>
